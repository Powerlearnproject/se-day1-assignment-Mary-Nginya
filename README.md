#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a discipline focused on the systematic development of high-quality software products using engineering principles, methods, and tools. It involves gathering and documenting user needs, designing the software architecture and user interface, writing code, testing and maintaining the software after deployment to the users. 
Its importance in the technology industry
Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of reliable, scalable, and innovative software solutions that meet user needs. By enabling the creation of software applications and systems,it drives technological innovations. 
It helps power solutions in modern aspects of life that rely on software solutions to automate processes, analyze data, and improve decision-making such as commerce, and healthcare services. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of Fotran programming language in 1957 by IBM which helped open the door to modern computing and ranks as one of the most influential software products in history.(e.g., Fortran, C)
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, Before the 1960s, software development was often unstructured and lacked formal methodologies, highlighting inconsistency and unreliability in software development. In 1968, NATO held a conference that formally introduced software engineering as a structured discipline, marking the beginning of formal software development processes.
3. In the 1970s, the advent of structured programming as a programming technique that improves the clarity and quality of computer programs by encouraging the use of control structures  such as like if/then/else, while, and for. 
4. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s which emphasized on flexible and iterative development that prioritize continous improvements, collaboration and rapid feedback loops by breaking projects into smaller manageable cycles.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements phase involving gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design phase involving creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture,system components and user interface.
Implementation phase to translate the design into actual code. It involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing phase where various tests are conducted to ensure the software  the software functions correctly and meets quality standards.
Deployment phase where the software is realesed to users or customers to use in a live environment.
Maintenance phase involving providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Traditional software development followed rigid processes like the 
Waterfall methodologies is where projects are planned upfront and follows a linear and sequential path with fixed phases e.g., requirements, design, implementation flowing downwards like a waterfall while Agile Methodologies are more flexible with projects following and iterative development enabling for collaboration and ease to adapt to changing reuirementts. 
A waterfall methodologies would be appropriate for projects that require extensive and detailed upfront documentation and have repeatable, predictable processes. It is especially effective for projects with well-defined deliverables where all the major project constraints are well understood and documented. 
Agile methodologies would be appropriate for complex evolving, and fast-changing projects which incorporate customer feedback throughout the process.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for designing, writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code using programming languages, testing, and maintaining software applications to translate requirements into functional software solutions.
A quality assurance engineer is responsible for ensuring that software meets quality standards before it is released by designing and executing test plans, test cases and test scripts. They focus on identifying defects, improving software reliability, and ensuring it functions as expected.
A project Manager Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects. oversees the planning, execution, and completion of software development projects. They ensure that the project stays on schedule, within budget, and meets business and technical requirements by breaking down tasks and allocating resources efficiently.
 Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs are applications that provides a comprehensive set of tools for software development in one interface for writing, debugging, and testing code. They offer features like syntax highlighting to imporove code writting efficiency making coding faster and reducing errors. They have built-in debuggers which help developers find and fix bugs efficiently. Many IDEs also integrate with testing frameworks. Examples are: Visual Studio and Eclipse.
Version Control System (VCS) helps teams track changes to code, collaborate efficiently, and maintain a history of modifications allowing for collaboration among team members of multiple developers working on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each other’s changes. Examples are: Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common challenges faced by softwared engineers may include requirements changing during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays
Another change could be pressure to deliver software products on schedule of tight deadlines can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, use of agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is testing individual components or modules of software. It helps in identifying bugs early in development and ensures each component functions correctly before integration.
Integration testing is testing interactions between different components or subsystems. It helps to detect issues when different modules interact and prevent integration failures that could affect the whole system.
System testing is testing the entire software system as a whole. It helps to ensure end-to-end functionality before release.
Acceptance testing is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting well-structured questions or statements as inputs to effectively communicate with AI models and get the best possible responses from AI models which are accurate, relevant, and useful to the user. Propompt engineering  It crucial in interacting with AI models as it helps refine the user's questions ensuring they are clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need leading to more precise and valuable responses. Good prompting helps unlock the AI models abilities to perform a wide range of tasks—writing, coding, summarizing, analyzing data. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a Vague Prompt: "Create a CV for a personal assistant." 
This prompt is vague because it lacks details about the personal assistant's experience, skills, or industry. It also doesn't specify format, tone, or structure.
Imporved Prompt: "As a hiring professional with 15+ years experience in the recruiting space, create a professional CV for a senior-level personal assistant with 5+ years of experience in executive support. Highlight skills in scheduling, travel coordination, email management, and confidentiality. Format it in a style suitable for a corporate job application."
This prompt is more effectives as it specifies the role and experience level, highlights key words as key skills to guide the AI on what to focus on and has a included the industry to fit the CV which helps set the tone, structure and format to generate a CV that meets the user's needs.
